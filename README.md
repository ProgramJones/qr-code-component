## My process

1. Created the boilerplate HTML.
2. Created the generic css styles from the style guide and figma file.
3. Created the specific styles for each element.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The big takeaway from this project was adding layers of box-shadow for a cleaner result.

```
box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(104, 119, 141, 0.05),
    0 15px 40px rgba(104, 119, 141, 0.2);
```

### Useful resources

- [Box Shadow Layering](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/bwtk83/simple_trick_to_make_your_boxshadows_look_much/) - This is the first time I've heard of layering box shadows. It makes much softer shadows.
